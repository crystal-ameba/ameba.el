;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides static syntax checking support for the Crystal language to the
;; Flycheck package.  To use it, have Flycheck installed, then add the following
;; to your init file:
;;
;;    (require 'flycheck-ameba)
;;    (add-hook 'ameba-mode 'flycheck-ameba)

;;; Code:

(require 'flycheck)

(defun flycheck-ameba--find-project-root (_checker)
  "Compute an appropriate working-directory for flycheck-ameba.
This is either a parent directory containing a .ameba.yml, or nil."
  (or
  (and
    buffer-file-name
    (locate-dominating-file buffer-file-name ".ameba.yml"))
  default-directory))
